You know, I used to be just like you...|Without a care in the world...|Living my life as part of a society that was nothing like me|I tried to fit in...
I tried really hard!|But no matter how many times I tried, the whole universe seemed to be against me and everything crumbled to pieces again and again... |That's where my story begins...
