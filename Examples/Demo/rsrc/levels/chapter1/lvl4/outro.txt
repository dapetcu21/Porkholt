The next day I found out that what the people from Beansville call the Goo is, actually, the primal energy which all forms of life give out.|He also told me that, what happened to me was something only a few achieved:|I could tap into that seemingly endless source of power, although, I then did it unconsciously and only at need.|I could learn to control this power and use it however I desired.| Oh... did I mention that he could do the same thing as well?| Yeah. Apparently, intense meditation is the alternative to blowing up a Goo deposit|...who knew?
